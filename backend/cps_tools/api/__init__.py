"""FastAPI routers for cps_tools backend.

Each tool lives in its own module (pole_compare, cover_sheet, etc.).
This package imports and re-exports their `router` objects so callers can easily
include all of them in a single call::

    from backend.cps_tools.api import routers
    app.include_router(routers)
